# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze e-commerce sales performance, identify profit trends, understand customer behavior, and uncover actionable business insights for decision-making.

This project focuses on **what decisions can be made from the data**, not just visualizations.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to understand:
- Why profits fluctuate across months

This dashboard addresses these challenges by providing a **single, interactive view of key sales and profit metrics**.

## 📁 Dataset

The analysis is based on two datasets:

- `Orders.csv` – Order-level transactional data  
- `Details.csv` – Product, category, and customer details  

The datasets were cleaned, transformed, and modeled using **Power Query** in Power BI.

---

## 📌 KPIs Tracked

- **Total Revenue**
- **Total Profit**
- **Total Quantity Sold**
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**
- **Monthly Profit Trends**

These KPIs help evaluate both **top-line performance** and **operational efficiency**.
